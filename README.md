R Shiney project for week 4

This contains the ui.R and server.R code that was developed to fulfill the week 4 R Shiney app 
with reactive components.

The app uses CO2 data from the R data library and plots a simple regression
with the Plants as factors.

The user gets to choose the plot lay out and the point colors.
If a bad input for color is used, red is used as default.
